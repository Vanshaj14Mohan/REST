CREATING RESTFUL API"S 
In this I'll discuss the roadmap of my module how I'm gonna make it.
1: GET => /posts => To get data from all posts. Index(main) route.

2: POST => /posts => To add new post. CREATE route.

3: GET => /posts/:id => To get data from a single post(using id). SHOW route.

4: PATCH => /posts/:id => To update data of a single post(using id). UPDATE route. 
can use PUT here too would work the same way as PATCH.

5: DELETE => /posts/:id => To delete a single post(using id). DESTROY route.
