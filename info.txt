REST: Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
Or we can say, It's a architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
Rest is an important concept in web development and it's widely used in building web services.

It is not a protocol or standard. While REST APIs can be accessed through a number of communication protocols, most commonly, 
they are called over HTTPS, so the guidelines below apply to REST API endpoints that will be called over the internet.

We use RESTful API's to perfrom CRUD operations on the server side. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
